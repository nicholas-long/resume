## Programming and Cybersecurity / Reverse Engineering Skill Set

- 5 years of experience using the Microsoft stack and 4 with web application development.
- Agile development: test development, code reviews, rapid prototyping, scrum meetings.
- Experience with Git and the branch, pull request, and code review workflow.  I have used Gitlab, BitBucket, and Github
- Hobbyist experience with Docker, docker-compose, and kubernetes: building swarms of containers for personal projects
- Ongoing cybersecurity education in offensive penetration testing skill sets with a focus on web application security, Linux, and Windows Active Directory security.
- Debugging and reverse engineering x86 and x64 binaries for Windows and Linux. I have extensive hobbyist experience with crackmes.one and HackTheBox challenges involving reverse engineering with IDA Pro and Ghidra: bypassing anti-debugging Windows API calls, reverse engineering virtual-machine-based obfuscated code, unpackers, and dynamic obfuscation, and I am able to bypass ASLR to develop binary exploitation code using return-oriented programming (ROP). I am also capable of finding bugs leading to binary exploitation such as stack overflows, heap corruption, and insecure printf calls.

## Achievements

- eJPT Certified Penetration Tester (certification ID 2798399) https://elearnsecurity.com/verify-certificate/
- Pro hacker rank on HackTheBox. Solved "insane" level reverse engineering and binary exploitation challenges. Completed binary exploitation track. Received badges for echoland and vmcrack challenges. https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/459321
- I am a contributor to the popular Seclists cybersecurity repository. I created a list of target files for local file inclusion (LFI) checks, and this list automatically updates itself from debian packages using bash scripts and github actions integrations.

- Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2021: placed 95 out of 4512 teams - solved all reversing and binary exploitation challenges including reverse engineering simulated ransomware to recover files
- Created a passive and active wifi attack script with awk and aircap-ng
- Developed a poker bot using neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.
- Reverse engineered BattlEye anti-cheat protection system and created a bypass
- Created an index of file hashes for a search engine by slowly retrieving a list of all of the repositories from GitHub's API and scanning the popular ones

# Work Experience

## October 2018 - Present
### Stay at home dad and Owner of Long Custom 3D Fabrication LLC
I was fortunate enough to be able to take time off from the workforce to help raise my two amazing children. I have had time to further my cybersecurity education with TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and Offensive Security Playgrounds. I run a side business where I create and sell custom products on Amazon, eBay, and local B2B sales, all using 3D printers. I am able to make my own 3D models with Blender or CAD modeling software and use slicer software to print them.
I make items such as gardening products and generic replacement machine parts.

## July 2014 - April 2018
### Application System Analyst - Trane, La Crosse, WI
My duties included development and providing support, bug fixes, and workarounds for customers.  During my time on the team, I helped with the transition from a domain specific C++ solution to a .NET MVC web application.  I was involved in every layer of the application’s stack and got experience with numerous programming languages, libraries, and paradigms.  Two times, my manager sent me to “That Conference”, a Microsoft-specific development conference.

## July 2013 - June 2014

### Software Development Intern - Trane, La Crosse, WI

My duties consisted of development, support issues, maintenance, and assisting with data fixes.  I created specialized software to automate several database related tasks, and I worked on projects to improve or replace several in-house software solutions.  This internship had a strong focus on .NET development, both Visual Basic and C#, and writing complex SQL queries.

## October 2010 – September 2011

### Part-time Master Control Operator - Fox 25/48 (WLAX/WEUX), La Crosse, WI

Responsible for preparing content, airing content, and FCC record-keeping requirements.
