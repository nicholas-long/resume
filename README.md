## Programming and Cybersecurity / Reverse Engineering Skill Set

- 4 years of experience with web application development using the Microsoft stack.
- Agile development: test development, code reviews, rapid prototyping, scrum meetings.
- Experience with Git and the branch, pull request, and code review workflow.  I have used Gitlab, BitBucket, and Github
- Ongoing cybersecurity education in offensive penetration testing skill sets with a focus on web application security, Linux, and Windows Active Directory security.
- Debugging and reverse engineering x86 and x64 binaries for Windows and Linux. I have extensive hobbyist experience reverse engineering with IDA Pro and Ghidra: bypassing anti-debugging Windows API calls, reverse engineering virtual-machine-based obfuscated code, unpackers, and dynamic obfuscation, and I am able to bypass ASLR to develop binary exploitation code using return-oriented programming (ROP). I am also capable of finding bugs leading to binary exploitation such as stack overflows, heap corruption, and insecure printf calls.
- Developed a poker bot using neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.

## Cybersecurity Achievements

- I am a contributor to the popular Seclists cybersecurity repository. I created a list of target files for local file inclusion (LFI) checks, and this list automatically updates itself from debian packages using bash scripts and github actions integrations.

- Pro hacker rank on HackTheBox.eu. Solved "insane" level reverse engineering and binary exploitation challenges. Completed binary exploitation track. Received badges for echoland and vmcrack challenges
- Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2021: placed 95 out of 4512 teams - solved all reversing and binary exploitation challenges including reverse engineering simulated ransomware to recover files
- Reverse engineering Windows challenge binaries on crackmes.one
- Reverse engineered BattlEye anti-cheat protection system and created a bypass

# Work Experience

## October 2018 - Present
#### Stay at home dad
I was fortunate enough to accumulate enough savings in my 20s that I was able to take time off from the workforce to help raise my two amazing children. I have had time to further my cybersecurity and devops education.

## July 2014 - April 2018
#### Application System Analyst - Trane, La Crosse, WI
My duties included development and providing support, bug fixes, and workarounds for customers.  During my time on the team, I helped with the transition from a domain specific C++ solution to a .NET MVC web application.  I was involved in every layer of the application’s stack and got experience with numerous programming languages, libraries, and paradigms.  Two times, my manager sent me to “That Conference”, a Microsoft-specific development conference.

## July 2013 - June 2014

#### Software Development Intern - Trane, La Crosse, WI

My duties consisted of development, support issues, maintenance, and assisting with data fixes.  I created specialized software to automate several database related tasks, and I worked on projects to improve or replace several in-house software solutions.  This internship had a strong focus on .NET development, both Visual Basic and C#, and writing complex SQL queries.

## October 2010 – September 2011

#### Part-time Master Control Operator - Fox 25/48 (WLAX/WEUX), La Crosse, WI

Responsible for preparing content, airing content, and FCC record-keeping requirements.

## January 2006 – June 2007

#### Part-time Temporary Employment - Kelly Services, La Crosse, WI

I worked in computer-related jobs including data entry, layout and design, and video editing.
