- Web Programming front end: Typescript, Javascript, AngularJS, jQuery, JSON, Bootstrap - 2 years
- Bash and AWK Scripting - 2 years
- Python - 2 years
- Dockerfile - 1 year
- Scala and functional programming - 1 year
- Java - 1 year
- 5 years of experience using the Microsoft stack and 4 with web application development.
- Experience with Docker and docker-compose, getting dependencies to build in Docker. Building Dockerfiles for open source projects to keep legacy code running.
- Experience doing data engineering in Kafka with KSQL queries and connectors
- Extensive experience piping Bash and AWK commands together to analyze and reformat text and data
- Agile development: test development, code reviews, rapid prototyping, scrum meetings.
- Experience with Git and the branch, pull request, and code review workflow.  I have used Gitlab and BitBucket, and I use Github extensively.
- Debugging and reverse engineering compiled programs in order to create exploits. I have extensive hobbyist experience with crackmes.one and HackTheBox challenges involving reverse engineering with IDA Pro and Ghidra. I am able to do return-oriented programming (ROP) and bypassing anti-debugging Windows API calls. I think this debugging experience can help debugging problems in compiled code.
