<h2 id="programming-and-cybersecurity--reverse-engineering-skill-set">Programming and Cybersecurity / Reverse Engineering Skill Set</h2>
<ul>
<li>5 years of experience using the Microsoft stack and 4 with web application development.</li>
<li>Agile development: test development, code reviews, rapid prototyping, scrum meetings.</li>
<li>Experience with Git and the branch, pull request, and code review workflow.  I have used Gitlab, BitBucket, and Github</li>
<li>Hobbyist experience with Docker, docker-compose, and kubernetes: building swarms of containers for personal projects</li>
<li>Ongoing cybersecurity education in offensive penetration testing skill sets with a focus on web application security, Linux, and Windows Active Directory security.</li>
<li>Debugging and reverse engineering x86 and x64 binaries for Windows and Linux. I have extensive hobbyist experience with crackmes.one and HackTheBox challenges involving reverse engineering with IDA Pro and Ghidra: bypassing anti-debugging Windows API calls, reverse engineering virtual-machine-based obfuscated code, unpackers, and dynamic obfuscation, and I am able to bypass ASLR to develop binary exploitation code using return-oriented programming (ROP). I am also capable of finding bugs leading to binary exploitation such as stack overflows, heap corruption, and insecure printf calls.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="achievements">Achievements</h2>
<ul>
<li>eJPT Certified Penetration Tester (certification ID 2798399) <a href="https://elearnsecurity.com/verify-certificate/">https://elearnsecurity.com/verify-certificate/</a></li>
<li>Pro hacker rank on HackTheBox. Solved &quot;insane&quot; level reverse engineering and binary exploitation challenges. Completed binary exploitation track. Received badges for echoland and vmcrack challenges. <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/459321">https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/459321</a></li>
<li>I am a contributor to the popular Seclists cybersecurity repository. I created a list of target files for local file inclusion (LFI) checks, and this list automatically updates itself from debian packages using bash scripts and github actions integrations. <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-etc-files-of-all-linux-packages.txt">SecLists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-etc-files-of-all-linux-packages.txt at master · danielmiessler/SecLists · GitHub</a></li>
<li>Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2021: placed 95 out of 4512 teams - solved all reversing and binary exploitation challenges including reverse engineering simulated ransomware to recover files</li>
<li>Created a passive and active wifi attack script with awk and aircap-ng</li>
<li>Developed a poker bot using neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.</li>
<li>Reverse engineered BattlEye anti-cheat protection system and created a bypass</li>
<li>Created an index of file hashes for a search engine by slowly retrieving a list of all of the repositories from GitHub's API and scanning the popular ones</li>

<p>I was fortunate enough to be able to take time off from the workforce to help raise my two amazing children. I have had time to further my cybersecurity education with TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and Offensive Security Playgrounds. I run a side business where I create and sell custom products on Amazon, eBay, and local B2B sales, all using 3D printers. I am able to make my own 3D models with Blender or CAD modeling software and use slicer software to print them.
I make items such as gardening products and generic replacement machine parts.</p>
